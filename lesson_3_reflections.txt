When would you want to add a remote repository 
rather than keeping all of your work local?

I would always want to do this since it gives
security to work. Additonally, it would allow 
me to share my work with other people.



Why might you want to always pull changes 
manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You computer is not always on ! Therefore, this 
might pose a reliability threat. Another reason 
could be beacuse the changes you made on Github 
are not needed on your local machine. So there is
no need to pull those changes.
