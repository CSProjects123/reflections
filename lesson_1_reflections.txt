I this lesson, I learned to use
the diff tool in command line. 
I also leaned some command line 
tools -  mkdir and redir. And
I learned to open up sublime with
command line - this was by adding
a path to the .bash_profile file.
Using diff, i immediately went to
the new edits that were made - lines
that were added lines that were
removed. Thus it was easier to see
the changes



How could having easy access to the 
entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the 
long term?

It saves time by allowing you 
to figure out what is working and 
what needs to be corrected. 



What do you think are the pros and 
cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically 
 saved, like Google Docs does?

 Con is that you have to be alert and 
 realize whena  commit is needed. 
 Pro -  you rest at a point that makes 
 sense.



 Why do you think some version control
 systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
 files in one commit, while others,
 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 The project is dependant of all files
 working together. There may be several 
 dependancies between the file, so it's 
 a good option to be able to access an entire 
 updated bunch as opposed to individual files




 How can you use the commands git log 
 and git diff to view the history of files?

 git log to see all the commits. note that 
 "q" can be used to get out of git log. 
 git diff with the ids tells us which lines
 were added and which lines were deleted.
 Note- since the last lesson, we also
 learned about git clone, which is followed
 by the desired URL




How might using version control make 
you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

Its easier now snce you can easily 
revert back to the latest version that 
does not have the bug. Note- we use cd ~ to get
to the home diretory 



Now that you have your workspace set up, what
do you want to try using Git for?
I'd like to try using git for saving different 
versions of my code. I'd also like to use it
in my project
