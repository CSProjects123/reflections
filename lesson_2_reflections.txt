What happens when you initialize a
repository? Why do you need to do it?

you initialize a repo when you want to
create a new git repo. It adds a .git 
file to the repo.




How is the staging area different from
the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The repository contains everything. 
The working directory is the directory
with the lastest files. The staging 
area is a place where you can move files, 
before finally commiting them all at once.
